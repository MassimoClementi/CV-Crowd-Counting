## Paper and code
Read the following paper as reference, understand how it works, try to run it and understand what kind of input data does it need (characterize the dataset)
> http://visal.cs.cityu.edu.hk/research/residual_regression_counting/

Requirements:
- python2.7
- pytorch 0.4.1

To make it run
- download test set
- download pretrained models
- run python test.py

**N.B:** Use "Colab" by Google to run the simulations, if needed

## Unity and UMA
Install `Unity` (recommended version `2018.4`) and learn C#
> https://unity.com
> https://learn.unity.com/course/getting-started-with-unity

Install `UMA` library for people generation
